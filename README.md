## Overview

This project implements a battery-powered smart indoor lighting system that combines edge computing with cloud infrastructure. The system uses ESP32 microcontrollers to manage RGBW LED tiles, detect room occupancy with mmWave sensors, and communicate with a cloud backend for monitoring and control.

Key features:
- Presence-based RGBW lighting triggered by room occupancy
- ESP-NOW mesh network with low-latency encrypted communication
- Battery-powered nodes with thermal and power management
- Cloud integration via MQTT and REST API
- Google Home integration
- OTA updates with rollback support
- Real-time Angular dashboard

**Project Status**: ✅ 95% Complete - Production Ready ([details](PROJECT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md))

## Architecture and diagrams

The ASCII architecture diagram has been removed. Refer to the PlantUML diagrams in `docs/diagrams`:

- `docs/diagrams/class_diagram.puml` — class relationships and main components
- `docs/diagrams/presence_detection.puml` — presence detection flow
- `docs/diagrams/pairing_sequence.puml` — secure pairing sequence
- `docs/diagrams/thermal_management.puml` — thermal derating logic
- `docs/diagrams/connectivity_sequence.puml` — coordinator, MQTT, and node connectivity sequence

### System components

Hardware layer
- Light Nodes (ESP32-C3): Battery-powered tiles with 4-LED SK6812B RGBW strips, temperature sensors, and ESP-NOW communication
- Coordinator (ESP32-S3): Central hub with mmWave presence detection, WiFi connectivity, and MQTT bridge

Communication layer
- ESP-NOW: Low-latency encrypted mesh network for node-to-coordinator communication (< 180 ms latency)
- MQTT: Pub/sub messaging for cloud telemetry and command distribution
- WebSocket: Real-time bidirectional communication for web dashboard

Application layer
- Backend (Go): REST API, MQTT handlers, OAuth2 authentication, OTA management
