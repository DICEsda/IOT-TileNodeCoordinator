# EMERGENCY DEBUGGING - Nothing Appears After Upload

## Current Situation
- Bootloader works (you see boot messages)
- WiFi.disconnect() message appears at 8354ms
- But NO output from your code
- setup() may be crashing silently

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Emergency Debug to main.cpp
- Prints `*** EMERGENCY DEBUG: setup() STARTED ***` at the very beginning
- Prints `[DEBUG] About to call coordinator.begin()` before coordinator init
- Prints `[DEBUG] coordinator.begin() returned` after coordinator init
- Prints `[LOOP ALIVE]` every 5 seconds in loop()

### 2. Added Serial Fallback to EspNow.cpp
- Direct Serial.println() calls in case Logger is broken
- Tracks exactly where WiFi.disconnect() happens (that's the warning you see)
- Shows progress through ESP-NOW initialization

## What To Do Now

### Step 1: Clean Build
```bash
cd coordinator
pio run -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1 -t clean
pio run -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1
```

### Step 2: Upload Fresh
```bash
pio run -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1 -t upload
```

### Step 3: Monitor and Report Back
```bash
pio run -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1 -t monitor
```

## Expected Output (If Working)

```
[Boot messages...]
[  8354][W][STA.cpp:533] disconnect(): STA already disconnected.

*** EMERGENCY DEBUG: setup() STARTED ***

==========================================
ESP32-S3 SMART TILE COORDINATOR
===========================================

Initializing Logger...
[LOGGER] initialized and ready
[DEBUG] Logger initialization complete
     xxxx | INFO  | *** BOOT START ***
     xxxx | INFO  | Initializing NVS flash...
     xxxx | INFO  | ✓ NVS initialized successfully

```

## Possible Outcomes

### Outcome 1: You see "*** EMERGENCY DEBUG: setup() STARTED ***"
✅ **setup() is running!**
- Logger was the issue (now fixed)
- Should see all subsequent messages

### Outcome 2: You DON'T see emergency debug
❌ **setup() is not running at all**
- Code didn't compile/link properly
- Old binary still on device
- Possible causes:
  1. Compilation error (check build output)
  2. Wrong upload port
  3. Flash corruption

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check compilation
pio run -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1 -v

# Erase flash completely
esptool.py --port COM[X] erase_flash

# Re-upload
pio run -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1 -t upload
```

### Outcome 3: Hangs at "[ESP-NOW] WiFi.disconnect() starting..."
❌ **WiFi.disconnect() is hanging**
- Known issue with ESP32-S3 USB CDC
- WiFi library has a bug

**Fix:** Comment out WiFi.disconnect() line in EspNow.cpp (line 82)

### Outcome 4: Crashes after coordinator.begin() starts
❌ **Something in Coordinator::begin() causes crash**
- Could be EspNow init
- Could be MQTT init
- Could be memory issue

**Fix:** We'll add more granular debugging

## Quick Diagnostic Test

If NOTHING works, add this at the very top of setup() in main.cpp:

```cpp
void setup() {
    // Absolute minimum test - NO libraries
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
        delay(100);
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
        delay(100);
    }
    
    // If LED blinks, setup() is running but Serial is broken
    // If LED doesn't blink, setup() is not running at all
}
```

## Report Back With

1. **Exact serial output** (copy/paste everything)
2. **Last message you see** before it stops
3. **Does LED blink?** (if you added the LED test)
4. **Build output** - any warnings or errors?
