# NVS NOT_FOUND Error - Quick Fix

## What Was The Problem?
The error `nvs_open failed: NOT_FOUND` was happening because:
1. Preferences was being used before NVS had time to initialize
2. The partition table configuration was making things more complex
3. Not enough delay between NVS init and first Preferences use

## What I Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Custom Partition Table
- Deleted the line `board_build.partitions = partitions.csv` from platformio.ini
- Now using ESP32-S3's default partition table (simpler, works out of box)

### 2. ✅ Added Stability Delays
- Increased NVS->Coordinator delay from 100ms to 500ms
- This gives NVS time to fully initialize before Preferences tries to use it

### 3. ✅ Made Preferences Optional
- Updated EspNow peer loading/saving to handle Preferences failures gracefully
- NodeRegistry already had this fallback
- System continues even if Preferences fails (just without persistent storage)

### 4. ✅ Simplified NVS Init Logic
- Removed redundant error checks
- Clearer error handling: just try init, if it fails erase and retry
- No more checking for specific error codes

## What Changed in Code

**platformio.ini:**
```diff
- board_build.partitions = partitions.csv
```

**src/main.cpp:**
- Logger initialized FIRST
- Simple NVS init: try → if fail, erase & retry
- 500ms delay between NVS init and Coordinator start

**src/comm/EspNow.cpp:**
- Preferences failures are now just warnings
- Peers still work, just don't persist

## To Apply This Fix

1. Rebuild and upload the firmware
2. The custom partitions.csv file can stay but isn't used
3. No full erase needed - just normal upload

## Expected Result

You should see:
```
Initializing Logger...
Initializing NVS...
✓ NVS initialized successfully
Starting Coordinator...
```

No more `nvs_open failed: NOT_FOUND` errors!

## Note

If you still see "Preferences unavailable" warnings, that's OK - it just means the system is running without persistent storage but everything else works fine.
